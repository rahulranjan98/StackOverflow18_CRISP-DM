# Decoding the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2018
***

## Project Motivation
Each year, the Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year they have published Annual Developer Survey resultsâ€”with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey this past January.

Five real world questions were answered using the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining). These questions are:
1. What languages, frameworks, & databases were most popular?
2. What are the top 5 developer types?
3. What is the proportion of the respondents who contributed to the Open Source or code as a hobby?
4. Which are the countries from which more response was received? (top countries with largest number of respondents)
5. What is the developer's primary Operating System?

## File Description
- A descriptive Jupyter Notebook `"StackOverflow18_CRISP-DM.iypnb"` containing the detailed analysis of the above questions.
- Dataset: `"survey_results_public.csv"` is the "Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2018" data that has been downloaded from ["Stack Overflow survey site"](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
